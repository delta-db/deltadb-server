Policies and Data Consistency
===

This may not be an issue and if it isn't then this should be moved to NOTES.md. Depending on the order in which policy changes/users edits are received it is possible for data to be recorded in non-deterministic ways. The servers should have super user permissions so that they can sync all changes and ensure eventual consistency. Could this ever be avoided?
